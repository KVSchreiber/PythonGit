# Exercise 4
# Create a game where the computer picks a random word and the player has to guess that word.
# The computer tells the player how many letters are in the word.
# Then the player gets five chances to ask if a letter is in the word.
# The computer can only respond with "yes" or "no".
# Then, the player must guess the word

#Pseudocode

#Create all variables
#Create word database

#User interface greeting with rules

#Initialize game loop

##Choose word
##Initialize guessing loop for letter guessing
###Input letter guess, restate current word with solved letters X5
###Escape letter guessing loop

##Restate current word with solved letters
##Input guess
##if guess correct then congratulations
##if guess incorrect then show word

##Ask for new game yes = return to beginning of loop no = escape

#Farewell message
