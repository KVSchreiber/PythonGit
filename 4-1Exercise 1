#Write a program that counts for the user. Let the user enter the starting number
# the ending number, and the amount by which to count.


#Create a starting number
start = int(input("What number would you like to start your range?"))
#Create an ending number
finish = int(input("What number would you like to end your range?"))
finish += 1
#Create an integer by which to count
increment = int(input("By how much would you like to count?"))

#Compute
for i in range(start, finish, increment):
    print(i)
